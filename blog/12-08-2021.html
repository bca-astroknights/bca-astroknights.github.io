        <h3>PDR Team Update</h3>
        <p>The PDR presentation was submitted December 1, 2021! We will continue to make minor changes to the 60-slide
            presentation to update minor design changes before we present it to the judges. Remember that the design
            that we will be presenting was created with influences from the build team and can be changed between now
            and the CDR (Critical Design Review).</p>
        <h3>Payload (Build and Programming) Team Update</h3>
        <p>We have bought some sensors and we will be picking up others soon. We are excited to intake these sensors and
            to begin testing out code with them.</p>
        <h3>Non-Tech Team Update</h3>
        <p>Another bake sale is in the works and we are coordinating dates and types of food we plan to sell. We are
            also continuously looking out for ways to fund our team.</p>
        <p>Further, we are working on coordinating different logistical issues for in-person launches and for our
            travels to Culpeper in April.</p>
