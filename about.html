    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>About the Team</h2>
    <p>We are a group of teenagers in grades 9-12 at Bergen County Academies (Bergen Academies, BCA) in Hackensack, New
      Jersey that are passionate about Astro and Aerospace design and technology. We meet with other students from
      Bergen Academies to educate and enjoy aerospace technology. We are made up of three teams: build, programming, and
      non-tech. The build team focuses on designing, CADing, and assembling the main project. The programming team
      focuses on writing code for the sensors embedded in the rocket, as well as the upkeep of our website. The non-tech
      team focuses ion getting funding for the club and paperwork, as well as general miscellaneous items to keep the
      team running. </p>

    <h2>The 2021-22 School Year Competition</h2>
    <p>This is our first year as a club. Our main goal for the 2021-22 Academic School Year is to build and launch a
      rocket at the “Battle of Rockets” rocketry competition in Culpeper, Virginia. The objective is to launch a rocket
      that deploys a payload with sensors and a camera that relays live telemetry data to a ground station. This rocket
      must be able to be launched 3 times with only minor field repairs (Learn More: <a
        href="www.rocketbattle.org/competition.html">www.rocketbattle.org/competition.html</a> , see “Deployable Sensor
      Payload Event” description).</p>
