        <h3>Overall Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We are working on PDRs</li>
            <li>We are ready to begin 3-D printing our first prototype</li>
            <li>A teacher is donating Arduino-compatible sensors</li>
            <li>We are planning another bake sale</li>
            <li>We are beginning to plan travel</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Build Team Update</h3>
        <p>PDRs are in the works and we have until December 1, 2021 to finish the presentation.</p>
        <p>We have all of the CAD models in, and we are going to start 3-D Printing parts in PLA as soon as possible!
        </p>
        <p>A generous teacher has offered to donate an enormous amount of arduino-compatible sensors, many of which are
            on our current parts list. There are also some sensors which our teacher does not have, in which we will
            need to buy those with our own funds. As soon as we get the first round of sensors we will start assembling
            them.
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Team Update</h3>
        <p>We are preparing for the enormous intake of sensors. We will update code once the sensors are obtained and
            assembled.</p>
        <h3>Non-Tech Team Update</h3>
        <p>We are working on setting up travel, feedback forms, and another bake sale. We have also secured a generous
            amount of money from a sponsor that has chosen to remain anonymous.</p>
        <p>The treasurer and non-tech leader are in early talks of travel plans and will begin reaching out to companies
            to price out the trip to Culepeper.</p>
        <p>We are also beginning the process of planning our next bake sale and we will email the bake sale coordinator
            for available dates.</p>
