        <h1>11-08-2021</h1>
        <p>We are officially registered with the Battle of Rockets Competition and we are working full speed ahead as
            our April 8th and 9th competition dates quickly approach. We are very excited to be participating in the
            Deployable Payload Event for the Battle of Rockets Competition!
            This is our first year as a team and we have a lot to update you on, so let’s jump in!
        </p>
        <h3>Build Team Update</h3>
        <p>For the past few months we have been planning and working on preliminary designs as well as testing out the
            rocket design. We are currently using “Open Rocket” and “SpaceCAD” to model our rocket’s performance. We are
            also using “Autodesk Inventor” and “Autodesk Fusion 360” to design the rocket structure.</p>
        <p>Currently, we are modifying the CAD models to begin PLA 3D printing in the next few weeks for prototyping a
            model that we hope to launch. We are also planning on using SLA (Resin) 3D printed parts for our final
            prototypes.</p>
        <h3>Programming Team Update</h3>
        <p>We have finished designing code for the sensors in our payload which will utilize Arduino sensors. We also
            worked on the code for our ground station in Python with a GUI using matplotlib. Finally, we also
            programmed our team website from scratch, desgined by <a href="https://github.com/kna27"
                target="blank">@kna27</a>.</p>
        <p>Now, we are waiting for the parts to come in. Then, we will be able to build, assemble, and upload the code
            onto the sensors.</p>
        <h3>Non-Tech Team Update</h3>
        <p>We have been busy behind the scenes making sure that the team can run fluently. We have made sure that the
            team is keeping to specific deadlines, and we are also working on securing funds. We have successfully ran a
            bake sale which brought in more than $350 in about 1 hour. However this will not be enough. </p>
        <p>Currently, we are also reaching out to potential sponsors and coordinating logistics to run more bake sales
            in the coming months. We are also trying to work with our school to coordinate in person meetings and how to
            recruit freshmen. Coming soon will be our first-ever in person launch, which we will be coordinating. We are
            also working with NAR and Tripoli certified mentors to make sure we will be following all necessary
            precautions.</p>
        <h3>Misc. Update/Upcoming Deadlines</h3>
